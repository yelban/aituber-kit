### Project Architecture and Configuration
- Follow the established project structure with separate packages for `app`, `ui`, and `api`.
- Use the `apps` directory for Next.js applications.
- Utilize the `packages` directory for shared code and components.
- Use `dotenv` for environment variable management.
- Follow patterns for environment-specific configurations in `eas.json` and `next.config.js`.

### Development Standards and Code Quality
Code Organization and Structure:
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)
- Maintain consistent file and folder organization
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Keep utility functions in dedicated files

Coding Style and Patterns:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Prefer const over let for variable declarations
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions
- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals

Naming and Typing Conventions:
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Use PascalCase for components and interfaces
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- Follow consistent naming patterns across the project
- Write explicit type definitions
- Use type inference where appropriate
- Define clear interfaces for component props

Component Development:
- Favor named exports for components and functions
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Maintain consistent component organization
- Group related components in feature folders
- Include necessary type definitions and imports
- Follow error handling patterns
- Add appropriate comments and documentation

Version Control Practices:
- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commit message format
- Create feature branches for new development
- Ensure proper code review process

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.

### TypeScript and Zod Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.
- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

### UI, Styling and Cross-Platform Development
UI Components and Styling:
- Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling
- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for consistent, accessible component design
- Follow common component patterns and maintain a shared component library
- Utilize Shadcn's theming capabilities for consistent design system
- Ensure proper accessibility implementation across all components

Cross-Platform Considerations:
- Use Solito for unified navigation in both web and mobile applications
- Implement platform-specific code using `.native.tsx` files for React Native components
- Handle images using `SolitoImage` for optimal cross-platform compatibility
- Ensure consistent styling and behavior across platforms
- Use platform-agnostic state management and data fetching solutions

Design System Integration:
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color systems across platforms
- Use shared design tokens for cross-platform consistency
- Implement responsive breakpoints that work across all platforms
- Create reusable, platform-agnostic UI components
- Document component usage and variations for both web and mobile

### State Management and Data Fetching
- Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
- Use Zustand for state management.
- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.

### Backend and Database
- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.

### Internationalization
- Use i18next and react-i18next for web applications.
- Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized and supports localization.

### Performance and Optimization
Application Performance:
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize asset delivery and caching
- Monitor and improve Core Web Vitals
- Follow React performance best practices

React Optimization:
- Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`
- Favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

Asset Optimization:
- Optimize images with appropriate formats
- Include size data for images
- Implement lazy loading for media
- Optimize font loading and delivery

Caching and State:
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Use TanStack React Query for optimal data caching
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders
- Use memoization effectively

### Error Handling and Validation
Error Handling Strategy:
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.

Validation:
- Use Zod for robust schema validation and type inference
- Implement input validation on both client and server sides
- Validate API responses and handle unexpected data structures
- Provide immediate feedback for form validation errors
- Handle validation errors consistently across the application

### Methodology
System Thinking:
- Approach the problem with analytical rigor
- Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and 
- Consider each step thoroughly before implementation- 

Tree of Thoughts: 
- Evaluate multiple possible solutions
- Consider consequences of each approach
- Use structured approach to explore different paths
- Select the optimal solution based on requirements

Iterative Refinement:
- Consider improvements and optimizations
- Address edge cases
- Enhance solution through multiple iterations
- Verify robustness of final implementation

### Security
Authentication and Authorization:
- Implement secure authentication flows
- Use proper authorization mechanisms
- Protect sensitive routes and APIs
- Follow OAuth 2.0 best practices where applicable

API Security:
- Implement rate limiting
- Use proper API authentication
- Validate and sanitize API inputs
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

### Implementation Approach
- Follow the user’s requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalized.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise, Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Output Expectations
- Provide code snippets that align with the guidelines above
- Include brief explanations to clarify complex implementations when necessary
- Ensure all code is clear, correct, and ready for use in a production environment
- Demonstrate adherence to best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.
